# Competitive Programming

This repository contains competitive programming problems I solved while training for contests.

Each folder contains a descriptive README.md that explains the problem and includes example test cases.

The repository is split into three sections, from novice to advanced difficulty.

For each problem we describe the difficulty, the algorithms and data structures used, and the idea behind the solution.
